# Division II

Although I found a lot of projects that I have found which were based on
following tutorials/sample code/derivative work, I have tried not to include
any.  Though I am sure I added something "extra" to most of them, at this point
I cannot be sure what is and what isn't my code.

## Folders
 * **android** Example Android projects, mostly broken
 * **clojure** Clojure code
 * **course** All the course code the students had access to as
   well as a selection of the internal repo from the Pygame course.
 * **games** All projects involving game development.
 * **lecrec** Lecture Recording code
 * **other** Everything else
 * **python** Sample python code
 * **tex** The latex files used to generate my final portfolio
 * **web** All projects related to web programming, front and backend.
 * **wpi** All homeworks/projects I found from my days at WPI.
