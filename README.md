# Division II

Although I found a lot of projects that I have found which were based on
following tutorials/sample code/derivative work, I have tried not to include
any.  Though I am sure I added something "extra" to most of them, at this point
I cannot be sure what is and what isn't my code.

 * **android** example Android projects, mostly broken
 * **gamedev** projects involving game development.
 * **gamification** gamification independent study
 * **lang** code from a variety of languages
 * **lecrec** lecture recording code
 * **portfolio** latex files used to generate portfolio
 * **pycourse** code/content for Pygame Course
 * **waking** machinima project
 * **web** projects related to web programming
 * **wpi** homeworks from my days at WPI.
