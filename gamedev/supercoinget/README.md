# Super Coin Get

This game emerged from a basic in-class example. As students wondered
how to add tilesheets to their game, I would make example code. Then,
if needed, I demonstrated how to integrate the example with this "coin
get". As the term went on, I kept adding more and more features as
examples of polish and showing what could be done with the concepts we
had learned in class. The end result was **Super Coin Get**.

## Gameplay
Your goal is to get the coins. That's it. Though every time you collect
one coin, two spawn. Careful though, they disappear after a while.

## Features
The features I was attempting to demonstrate by the end of the project included:

 * shadow layers
 * depth sorted sprites
 * custom collisions
 * cheat codes
 * menus/pausing
 * highscore
 * animations/sound
 * tiles
 * more robust game loop (handles lag)

## Requirements
 * python 2.6+
 * pygame
