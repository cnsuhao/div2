Alec's Contributions
====================
I was primarily in charge of player and camera movements. I made
all camera code, most registrars (used to register things instead
of Game.cpp), player, game/gameworld, pivots, ropes, input, grips,
constants, as well as the outline for how to add Methods(triggers) and
commands

My primary function was to make level design as easy on the artists as
possible so there are a lot of added triggers to make placing pivots,
ropes, camerashifts, etc much easier, as well as changing the player
movement.

The camera is a customized Chase cam with a lot of added features. All
variables can be changed through either a trigger or a console command.

The player movement is made almost entirely from scratch and relies
heavliy on detecting States from what movement it is in. Move code sets
up animation and where to move while Travel actually updates it.

For The Monkey's Left Eye I worked on a lot of the smaller parts of the
game. I set up the loading of new worlds, the interface for the levels
and collecting of coins and monkey pieces. I also set up the main menu
that lets you start a new game. I also got the movement set up for the
various types of moving objects in the game.
