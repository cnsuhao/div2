# Space Munch

*Space Munch* was a game developed over the course of about 4 hours as a
crash course into python, pygame, and 2D sprite games. I ran this crash
course as a prep for a 38-hour gamejam being held later in the week. The
gameplay is based loosely on space invaders.

## Gamplay:
The player is spawned in a world full of munches.  They must defeat them all while avoiding being shot.

 * *Controls:* Use the left/right arrow keys to move and spacebar to shoot.
 * *Spawning*: Enemies "split", destroying all enemies will essentially end the game
 * *Enemies Bullets:* green rects, decrease player health by one and decrease firepower
 * *Powerups:* blue rects, add one health and increase firepower

## Game Jam
In January 2008, the former *38 Studios* held a game contest. The topic
was whoever could best use their companies mascot, Munch. As president
of the WPI Game Development Club, I organized a 38-hour long gamejam for
WPI students and invited other colleges to join in. 38 Studios helped
with publicity and various developers showed up throughout the weekend
to talk to the participants. Curt Schilling showed up to see how we were
progressing and bought everyone pizza. The event was a huge success.

## Requirements
 * python
 * pygame
