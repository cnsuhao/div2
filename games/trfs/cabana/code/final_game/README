This is all the code copied straight out of Cabana.  Folders correspond to
"grouped nodes."  A lot of this code is unused and doesn't make much sense but
is included here for completions sake.  JSS is an implementation of CSS in
javascript.

All code here was written by Alec Goebel except external libraries.
