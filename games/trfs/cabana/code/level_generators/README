Level generator algorithms. These do line up correctly with how things
work in cabana. I (Alec) did not take the time to go through them and
fix variable names and how random was being generated because I did not
have time to test/guarentee they would break nothing.

However, all the level types were being generated correctly in the form
which the Cabana app required and other than variable renaming it should
go straight in without a hitch. It's a pity they didn't make it in on
time.

All levels were created by James.
