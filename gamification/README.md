# Course Gamification

This is the "final" document I created for my independent study on Gamifying
Coursework.  The document is largely incomplete since it was originally
supposed to just be the research/preliminary phase of a Div III.  Still, the
ideas behind the Topics, the game World, and Quests were largely "finalized"
and thought out.
