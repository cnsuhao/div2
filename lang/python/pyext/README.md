# Extending Python

 * **enum.py** Created a basic immutable enumeration class
 * **typing.py** Created a decorator class, `typed`, which allows functions to guarantee the types of their arguments and return values at runtime.
 * **sync** A decorator called `locked` which enforces a thread lock be acquired before the method is used.
