Help documents
 * generated from rest/markdown syntax + documentation
 * pause interface when help is clicked, opened in new tab

Interface:
 * "leanback" design philosophy
 * all functions should be easy to get to via a google tv interface
 * create custom mappings for custom user agents?
 * potential to redirect to phone the same way
 * keyboard and mouse controls

Faster loading:
 * generate as little in the template as possible
 * couchdb backend might wind up being better but probably not for the admin
 * presentation layouts are defined nicely
