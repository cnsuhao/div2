\chapter{Community Service}

My community service was the work I did in 2012-Jan as a TA for Paul Dickson's Web Application course.

\section*{TA-CS-2 (CS-206) (2012J) \\ Building Web Applications \\ Evaluation}

Alec did not originally intend to TA this class but as Jan-Term
progressed it became obvious that his help was needed with the course
and he volunteered. Alec helped students in class and out and made sure
that they could build their websites. He helped with lectures and made
sure that all concepts were explained clearly. This course would not
have been successful without Alec's contributions. He did a great job as
a TA for this course.

In addition, my activities which could not count include:

\begin{description}
    \item[Americorps Volunteer] \hfill \\ I served 1700 hours (full-time for a year), though was paid less than minimum wage 
    \item[WPI's Game Development Club President] \hfill \\ Took up most of my time during my last year at WPI, but I've lost contact with anyone who could have signed off. 
    \item[Programming/IT Support] \hfill \\ I aide others in IT/Programming both on campus and on various IRC/support sites everyday but don't care to get it formally approved. 
\end{description}
