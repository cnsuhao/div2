My successes and troubles at Hampshire stem from the same double edge sword; I
have been working on large and challenging projects.  Every course I did not
get an evaluation in was largely due to being overly ambitious and spread thin
by the time the final projects came around.

However, Hampshire has given me many unique opportunities for TAing and
independent work as an undergrad, which I tried to make the most of.
