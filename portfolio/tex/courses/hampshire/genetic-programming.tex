\subsection*{Self Eval}
This was a course I didn't put the time into properly the first time
around. I was very involved in everything else I was taking/working on
and this one fell to the back burner for too long. In addition, though
my final project wasn't un-doable I made too much out of it. By the end
of the semester I had gone half insane and was determined the only way
I could get things working was using Cascalog (a prolog-like Clojure
library built for Hadoop clusters.)

That said, I spent a fair amount of time creating a few tiny DSL's for
my creatures to evolve. I wouldn't say I learned a whole lot, but I got
a better understanding of GA and Clojure data structures.

TAing the course went much better. I was more involved and realized just
how difficult I made things myself last time around. Still, GP isn't my
field and I still find it a bit like black magic. I was able to help
students debug and design their software, but still don't have a great
sense on how they can improve things.
