\subsection*{Self Eval}
This course was a unique experience. It became quickly apparent that I
didn't have the same knowledge background as my peers and often felt
lost. Also, as a "math" musician, the sort of "just feel it" mentality
was one that gave me trouble. I thought about what I was doing instead
of just going with it.

That said, as an HCI guy it's always good to be exposed to a new way
of thinking. Learning how musicians just go with things has changed my
thoughts on digital instrument design significantly, opting for more of
an intuitive interface than explicit controls.

Still, "you have to dig it to dig it," and clearly I don't.
