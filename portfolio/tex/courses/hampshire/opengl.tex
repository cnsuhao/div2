\subsection*{Self Eval}
I read through a couple of OpenGL textbooks and many tutorials. In
addition to reinforcing and relearning the little OpenGL I had picked
up over the years, I got a better sense of the pipeline, how to use
buffers, and shaders. Most of my time was spent converting tutorial C
code to python, and redesigning it to be more pythonic and modular. By
the end of the course I had written a pyglet program to load and display
collada mesh data and shaders.
