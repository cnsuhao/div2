\subsection*{Self Eval}
These two courses were my first time TAing and completely changed my
outlook on education. I knew on some level that it took more effort to
teach than do, but I didn't really have an appreciation for it. What
surpised me most was how long it takes to create and grade an assigment
versus just doing it.

There isn't much to say about the courses themselves. Students made
websites and I helped mostly with the javascript and CSS. Still, I got
hooked on TAing. Finding out how to translate my own thoughts into how
others think is something I was good at from working previously in IT.
Being able to do it in the field I'm passionate about was even better.
