\coursedesc
This course provides an accelerated introduction to design and
implementation of functional programs. The course presents the material
from CS 1101 at a fast pace (so students can migrate their programming
experience to functional languages), then covers several advanced
topics in functional programming (potential topics include macros, lazy
programming with streams, and programming with higher-order functions).
Students will be expected to design, implement, and debug programs in a
functional programming language.

\courseself
This was the course that first opened my eyes to the beauty of
functional programming. We spent most of our time practicing how to
use recursive algorithms. For my final project I created a graphics
simulation DSL.
