\subsection*{Instructor Narrative}
The goal of this independent study was to learn more about the field
of Gamification. Gamification is the process of taking some everyday
task and turning it into a game which gives you points based on doing
that task. Alec Goebel spent the beginning of the semester researching
Gamification before deciding to Gamify an introductory programming
course. To Gamify the course he figured out how material could be broken
into individual pieces that could become challenges. An example of
what Alec came up with was doing problems related to course material,
the more problems they could solve on the course material the higher
the player's score and the more merits they win. This is only one of
the ways that Alec created to make learning the material a game and to
relate score to learning. Alec was successful in this study because he
developed all of the mechanisms necessary to turn a course into a game.
