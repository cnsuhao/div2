\subsection*{Instructor Narrative}
Alec was one of two teaching assistants for this upper-level computer
science course, and he was the one with more relevant prior experience.
His prior experience with "functional-style" programming and with
the Clojure programming language, which we used in this course, was
particularly relevant and helpful. Alec's teaching assistant duties
included attending class regularly, helping students during in-class
coding sessions, helping to administer in-class presentations, answering
student questions during office hours and by email, and helping to
organize submitted student work.

Alec's performance in all aspects of his work for this course was
excellent. His strong programming skills made him particularly valuable
as a resource outside of class, and he was reliable and conscientious
in all of his duties. I think that this was also significant learning
experience for Alec, both because of the teaching experience that he
gained and because of his deeper immersion in materials covered in the
course. The course was substantially improved by his participation and
it was a pleasure to work with him in this capacity.
