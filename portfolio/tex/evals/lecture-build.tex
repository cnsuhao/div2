\subsubsection*{Instructor Narrative}
The goal of this independent study was to get a previously built
automatic lecture capture system deployed and capturing lectures. Alec
was successful in achieving this goal. He was able to get the system
capturing, processing, and posting lectures robustly without requiring
any human interaction. He was also able to get this system to record
five separate courses that were taught in the classroom containing
the lecture capture equipment, and to have the captured lectures
posted within twenty-four hours of the class being recorded. This was
especially impressive considering that a graduate student who had been
working on the same project had been unable to accomplish this same task
in a period of two years. Alec could not have been more successful in
this independent study.
