\subsubsection*{Instructor Narrative}
The goal of this independent study was to update the lecture
presentation software associated with a lecture capture system, and
Alec was successful in achieving this goal. Alec was able to take
the existing presentation software and smooth out its performance by
including a new video player and adding video streaming. He was also
able to expand the list of web browsers within which the software runs.
After completion of this update, Alec was able to run both focus groups
and surveys aimed at finding out what parts of the interface to improve.
Alec was very successful in this independent study and made significant
progress in improving this software.
