\subsection*{Instructor Narrative}
Alec Goebel's goal with this independent study was to increase his
knowledge of and comfort using OpenGL. To achieve this goal he decided
to work through a couple of OpenGL text books doing examples until he
felt comfortable to build an OpenGL renderer that could hand image
files generated by standard software like Blender. Alec ran into a lot
of problems with this study ranging from poorly written textbooks and
online references to software inconsistencies between the C++ examples
he was looking at and the Python code he was writing. While Alec did not
find total success with the renderers from standard file formats he was
hoping for he did increase his overall knowledge of OpenGL. As Alec is
now comfortable working in OpenGL to render any type of image he sees
fit, the independent study was a success.
