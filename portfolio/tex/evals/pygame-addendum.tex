\subsection*{Instructor Narrative}
For this independent study Alec Goebel took the material from the CS
112 course he was TAing and added to it, teaching a small group of
students additional material. In order to do this Alec taught one 80
minute lecture a week that built on the CS 112 course material from that
week. The purpose of this was to fill in details that are important for
computer science but don't fit into an introductory game programing
course. Alec designed all of the material for these lectures and wrote
and graded homework assignments that went along with them. He did a
great job organizing this and teaching it and the students who attended
his lectures benefited from them. Alec could not have done a better job
with this and the experience should serve him well when next he teaches
a course.
