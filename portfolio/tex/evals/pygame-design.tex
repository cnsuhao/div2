\subsection*{Instructor Narrative}
Alec Goebel did a great job in this independent study and succeeded
in building an introductory programming course in Python that uses
Pygame as motivation. He designed a course of study that covers the
fundamentals of computer science and presents them in an order that
logically fits with game design. He has developed lecture notes for the
course and the homework assignments that correspond as well as building
an infrastructure for students to turn in assignments. Alec designed a
course that uses standard practices for program development in industry
to ensure that students will learn real world programming concepts. Alec
would have been hard pressed to do a better job in this independent
study or with this course.
