\subsection*{Instructor Narrative}
For this independent study Alec Goebel worked closely with two other
students and a faculty member to prepare an introductory computer
science course that uses game development to teach Python. This group
filled in details of the course that Alec developed the previous
semester in a different independent study. He took the lead in creating
code for lecture examples and homework assignments. Alec was the leader
who kept the other two students working on this project on task and
moving towards the final goal. Through the development of this material
Alec was able to improve his understanding of teaching and to gain a new
perspective on course development. Alec could not have done a better
job in this independent study and a course could not have been created
without his contributions.
