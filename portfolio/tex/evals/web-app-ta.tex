\subsection*{Instructor Narrative}
Alec did not originally intend to TA this class but as Jan-Term
progressed it became obvious that his help was needed with the course
and he volunteered. Alec helped students in class and out and made sure
that they could build their websites. He helped with lectures and made
sure that all concepts were explained clearly. This course would not
have been successful without Alec's contributions. He did a great job as
a TA for this course.
