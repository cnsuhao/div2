\subsection*{Course Description}
Programming Web Pages for Poets, Artists, and Scientists: This is a course
about building web pages but it is also a course about learning to program.
From day one students will be building web pages and as the course progresses
these web pages will become more complex. This course will focus on web page
look and feel as well as the underlying code. Students will learn to use HTML,
JavaScript, and cascading style sheets. The programming skills learned in this
course can be applied to more advanced courses. No previous programming
experience is required.

\subsection*{Instructor Narrative}
Alec Goebel did a great job as a teaching assistant for this web design
course. He attended one lecture a week and added greatly to those
lectures by giving students a different perspective on the course
material. Alec ran one session of lab hours every week where he went
above and beyond answering student questions, often staying late because
of student need. He also graded three of the homework assignments.
Alec's presence as a teaching assistant improved the course.
