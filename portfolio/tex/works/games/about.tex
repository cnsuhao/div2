\section{Pygame Crash Courses}

% TODO shmup listing
I have run a number of crash courses in Pygame over the years.  
Overall, I find the best way to get programmers up to speed is to go through creating a shoot 'em up (shmup)
Shmups have most of the elements they may run into while requiring relatively few components themselves.

One of the first courses I ran was for the WPI Game Development Club.  
As its president, I was organizing a 38-hour gamejam and held a Pygame tutorial so that first year programmers could join in without previous game making experience.
The result was the game Space Munch, a simple space-invaders derrived game.
