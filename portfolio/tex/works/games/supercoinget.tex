\section{Super Coin Get}
"Super Coin Get" was a simple example game that I kept fleshing out
towards the end of the term. As students began working on their final
projects, I would create a couple more examples. Then, to make sure
I could integrate the samples with the working code, I added it onto
Super Coin Get. In the end it evolved into a good example of what a
great/polished should look like.

In the end, the final version includes cheats, high scores, application
states, spritesheets, animations, spawners, custom graphics layers,
various "widgets" (eg text blocks, tiled images), and more.

The gameplay couldn't be simpler.
