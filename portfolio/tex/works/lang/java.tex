\section{Java}

Though not my favorite language, I have been programming Java the longest.
Since it is my father's primary language, I first picked it up before high
school. That said, I didn't really "get it" until the AP Computer Science exam
in 2004.  After that, it was my language of choice for a long time, and I
quickly tried to master everything OO.

These days, I mainly use it for Android and interop-ing with other languages
like Clojure.  Still, on occassion I break into it for knocking out a quick
universal program, like creating a birthday card applet.

I have a solid foundation for Java, OO Design, and AWT/Swing UI's which has
helped me enormously for learning other languages.  Java was the first language
I knew as a computer scientist, not a hobbyist.
