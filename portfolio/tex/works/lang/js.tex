\section{Javascript}

It scares me most days how often I use Javascript.  Though it is not a terrible
functional language, it is certainly not without it's oddities.  But since I
have done a lot of web GUI work and web app design over the years, it is
definitely one of the languages I am most familiar with.

Yet by using jQuery, underscore, spine, and extending the native prototypes I
can get it close to where I want it to be syntactically.  Even if it won't run
quickly at all.
