\section{Python}

Considering how much code in this portfolio is python, it should be no
surprise that this is my primary language.  I first picked it up in 2002 or so,
but I didn't really delve into it until I started teaching myself Pygame in
2003.  Python is the one language I have consistently gone back to, usually at
least once a month.  Though I am now leaning more towards Clojure and Ruby for
metaprogramming and power, it is still my scripting language of choice.
