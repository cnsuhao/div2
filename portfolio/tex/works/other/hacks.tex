\section{Life Hacks}

Hardly a day goes by without me writing some kind of program/script. My
window manager, text editor, and web browser all need little scripts
and tweaks. A good deal of my spare time is just spend making my life a
little easier.

I also try to make other people's lives easier with bookmarklets, simple
websites, excel macros, and the like. As far as I'm concerned, if a
computer is working against the way you think it should, change it.

\codeinput{lang/bash/newtv.sh}{New Tv CGI}{bash}{}
{A simple CGI script I wrote so users of my home server could pop on the web to find out what had finished downloading in the last week}

\codeinput{lang/bash/cbr2cbz.sh}{CBR to CBZ converter}{bash}{}
{A script which just converts a cbr to a cbz (rar to zip).  A good example of the sort of script I write out often as a life hack}

\codeinput{lang/bash/thumbnailer.sh}{Thumbnail Montage}{bash}{}
{A script that would generate a montage of thumbnails for a given video file}

\codeinput{lang/python/contacts.py}{Palm Pilot to Google Contacts}{Python}{}
{A converter I wrote when my mother switched from Palm to Android. The existing software could export to CSV fine, but not into a format GoogleContacts could understand}
