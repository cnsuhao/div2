\section{System Administration}

I have been slowly becoming a proper sysadmin ever since I switched
to Linux. In addition to my personal desktop I have admined a slew of
web/soho/virtual servers over the years.

At this point, creating scripts is second nature instead of just
\emph{performing} a given task. The overlap between being able to code
quickly and know what I want my machine to do has been invaluable. I
finally got to push myself to my limits with the Lecture Recording
project, being the first time I had to wire so many systems together
with \texttt{bash} and maintain a production machine.

\codeinput{lecrec/scripts/upload.sh}{Lecture Upload}{bash}{}
{A script to upload a lecture once it is processed.  Since it was setup as a cronjob running every minute, it uses files as a mutex lock to prevent conflicts}

\codeinput{lecrec/webmanic/courses/management/commands/addcourse.py}{Add Course Command}{Python}{}
{As we started maintaining the server, being able to simply run commands to add presentations or courses via ssh rapidly became a requirement}

\codeinput{lecrec/scripts/fps.py}{Frames Per Second Calculator}{Python}{}
{Many scripts we created were simply utility scripts to do some sort of calculation/transformation on some files before passing it on to the next program or script.}
