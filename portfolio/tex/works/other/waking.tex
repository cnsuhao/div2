\section{Waking}
\label{works:waking}

Waking was a 4 part movie (approx 31 mins) created for my machinima
course. Filming/production took place over approx 4-5 weeks. We used a
variety of games, rendering, and real life.
% TODO:  bit more about the project, game engines, software, etc

\subsection*{Synopsis}
A sentient multiplayer bot, Vatar is the first true AI in existence.
Programmed to know only the game world and servers that govern them,
Vatar's perception of existence lasts from the moment of spawn to the
final kill of the match. When the creators decide to test the limits
of Vatar's capabilities, Vatar must come to grips with the newfound
abilities and unfamiliar emotional bonds made.
