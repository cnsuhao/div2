-All managers need console commands (preferably automated)
-messaging system
-lots of hooks
-Engine should have a "glue" file/structure, a single place to handle replacements and requirements


Modules:
	modules have a variety of requirements:
		other modules:  for specific interfaces
		Compatibilities: flags, functionality
	req can be hard or soft
	modules have configurable options
	modules have default settings

	modules have levels:
		plugin
		application
		system
		core
	
	They all fail differently and have different warnings
	
	Module methods are mostly hooks so debugging pieces are automatic
		except in the core
	
	Other pieces as you go
	


features needed for rapid coding:
	callbacks/hooks/closures
	typing hidden
	
	scripted for the most part:
		AI scripted
	
	get a main loop up and running
	set buttons
	add entities
		expand existing code
	GUI
