# Sample Code

##anim_and_sound
Cleaner version of the resource management and animation techniques we went over in class

##camera
An example of drawing sprites relative to a camera instead of fixed positions.

##level_tilesheets
A way to load a level tilesheet and a `.lvl` text file in order to draw a background instead of hardcoding.  Tiles themselves were still hardcoded.

##menus_and_states
A simple application framework to allow for pause/main menus in addition to the game

##shmup_example
Working version of the shmup homework assignment

##sidescroller
A basic sidescroller with a camera, jump physics, and level collision

##signals
A simple example of using `louie` 

##spritesheets
How to load, split, and animate a spritesheet automatically.

##tiefighter
Final version of class code for ongoing tiefighter example.  Eventually included multiple Sprite classes, spawners, custom collision detection, and explosions.
