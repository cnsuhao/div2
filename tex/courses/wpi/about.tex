\subsection*{Academic Structure}
Every school year is broken into four seven-week terms, and students
take on average three courses a semester or overload with four. Each
course covers the same material as a semester or trimester at most other
colleges. Due to the intense nature of the BS program, students are
expected to declare their major by November of their freshman year.

Courses meet four days a week for 50 minutes a day, with homework
averaging about twice the amount of time spent in class. Many classes
also had an additional lab component, including most Computer Science
courses.

WPI has a unique grading system to encourage students to take courses
outside of their comfort zone. Students can earn an A, B, C, or No
Record (NR); nothing below a C appears on the student's transcript and
so there is no record of the student taking the course.

The course numbering is standard with the first digit referring to the
year \emph{most} students will take the course (e.g. 1000 courses are
taken freshman year.) However courses only have recommendations, not
requirements, so they can be taken at any time. In addition any course
ending in an "X" is experimental, including when a course is first
introduced.
