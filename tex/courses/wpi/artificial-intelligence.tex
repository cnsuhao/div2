This course studies the problem of making computers act in ways which we
call intelligent. Topics include major theories, tools and applications
of artificial intelligence, aspects of knowledge representation,
searching and planning, and natural language understanding.

Students will be expected to complete projects which express problems
that require search in state spaces, and to propose appropriate methods
for solving the problems.

When I entered WPI, I thought I would go into video game AI. As I
learned more about game AI, my interest waned.

This course was quite useful though. We had to implement a wide range
of topics including DF/BF/A* searches, a forward chaining rules, and
genetic algorithms. I still find myself consulting the text books from
this course.

Although I did well on the code portions, that was not enough to get a
good grade. Our code was not run. Instead, we were graded on our debug
statements and accompanying essay. Between this and the exams which
covered the readings (not the homeworks or lectures) my grade went down.
