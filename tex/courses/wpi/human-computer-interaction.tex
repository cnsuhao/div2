This course develops in the student an understanding of the nature and
importance of problems concerning the efficiency and effectiveness of
human interaction with computer-based systems. Topics include the design
and evaluation of interactive computer systems, basic psychological
considerations of interaction, interactive language design, interactive
hardware design, and special input/output techniques.

"I am not normal". The litany we said everyday in class to remind us
that the way tech people think is not how end users do. While the course
itself was not wonderful, this brief look into HCI made me leave game
design in the long run.

The course involved no programming. Instead, we analyzed various UIs,
ran usability studies, and made a few interfaces. Emphasis was put on the
fact that HCI relies on standards and intuition on some level. The final
project for this course was working with a group to design a language
free "pen pal" application.

Fun tidbit about this course. Although I got a fair amount out of it,
I didn't think it was quite what I was interested in. For a long time
(until speaking with Paul) I insisted on saying I wanted to study CHI,
distinguishing my interests from what this course represented.
