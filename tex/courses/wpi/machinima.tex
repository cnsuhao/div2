This course will address the cinemagraphic and narrative techniques
involved with film making using video-game technology. Creation and
development of characters, environments, and narrative structures will
be explored. Using commercial game engines and audio/video editors,
students will write, design, and produce complete animated movies.
Industrial and artistic applications of this film making technique are
discussed as well as how Machinima is contextualized in the history of
film animation and visualization.

\courseself
This was my first major group/project work. I lived and breathed the
final project for this course and it paid off.

For most of the course we were just making movies. For the project, I
was part of a "super group"; we joined two groups of four and did twice
the work. Though we shared responsibilities, I was one of the driving
forces and acted as producer/director/editor.

After the four weeks of work, "Waking" was done. The end result was a 4
part series, about 31 mins long. We used four game engines, Maya, and
real life. Coordinating eight people, different video files/formats and
everything else was a surprisingly tough, though rewarding, undertaking.
In the end, we exceeded our expectations and got second place in a
"Machinima Premiere" contest.
