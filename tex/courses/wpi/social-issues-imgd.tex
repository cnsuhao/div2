\coursedesc
This course provides students with a realistic assessment of the
potential and problems related to interactive media and games,
especially computer games, and their effects on society. Topics include
individual and group behavior, diversity, human responsibility, ethical
and legal issues, and intellectual property. The course examines the
issues from various points of view, and discover the political, social,
and economic agendas of the people or groups championing those points
of view. Students will write papers, participate in discussions, and
research related topics.

\courseself
This course concentrated on the less technical aspect of game design.
We spent a lot of time on controversial games, emergent issues in MMOs,
less common types of games (serious, persuasive), and types of players.
We also spent a lot of time on how games motivate players and teach
players, knowledge I have used a lot since for teaching.
