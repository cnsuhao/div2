\coursedesc
This course explores different types of story within gaming and other
interactive media. It delineates between linear, branching, and emergent
storytelling, identifies hybrids, and finds new modes of making
compelling narrative. A variety of games are discussed, including early
text-based adventures, role- playing games, shooters, and strategy
games. Students will construct characters, situations, and narratives
through game play and scripted cut scenes. Students will explore and use
visual storytelling techniques.

\courseself
This course could best be described as eccentric but effective study
of interactive storytelling. We learned about improv theater, Dungeons
and Dragons, and ran an ARG (Alternate Reality Game). Still, the skills
from these activities have been surprisingly useful. The techniques of
guiding players and dealing with new situations on the fly has a lot in
common with teaching.
