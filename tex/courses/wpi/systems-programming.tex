\coursedesc
This course introduces students to a model of programming where the
programming language exposes details of how the hardware stores and
executes software. Building from the design concepts covered in CS 2102,
this course covers manual memory management, pointers, the machine
stack, and input/output mechanisms. The course will involve large-scale
programming exercises and will be designed to help students confront
issues of safe programming with system-level constructs. The course will
cover several tools that assist programmers in these tasks. Students
will be expected to design, implement, and debug programs in C++ and C.

\courseself
Although I had touched C++ before, this was the first time I actually
used the language. We spent most of the course programming in C,
learning about memory allocation, and implementing in-place data
structures. This course showed me how much I dislike low level
languages.
