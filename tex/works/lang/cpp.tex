\section{C/C++}

In general, system level programming is my weakest area. As much as I
have delved into functional style programming I have avoided memory
allocation. As a result, many of my elegant programming interfaces can
run horrifically slow. That said, I am certainly comfortable enough in
C/C++ to program in it or modify existing code as I need to.

I first picked it up in my early days of high school and then didn't touch it
again until college.  Once I got the hang of pointers at WPI, I started
regularly using it for Game Development, both in class and with a GDC
development team.  I used it for a wide range of game-engines\footnote{e.g. C4,
OGRE, SDL/OpenGL} before I stopped being a game developer.  Most recently, I
needed to use it for the lecture recording project to get the capturing and
processing code to play nice.
