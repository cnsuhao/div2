# Django Projects/Snippets

**Note** all these examples were written for Django 0.94 and Django 1.0rc.  There is little to no chance that they will run so I simply 
removed a lot of the boiler plate code and kept the important bits where possible.

 * **cms-models** attempts at creating a CMS with a form of version control via Django models
 * **custom-template-tags** a few custom template tags to add more control flow to Django templates (i.e. switch statements)
 * **sticky** a simple Django app to easily add global sticky notes to a webpage so users can leave notes for themselves/others
 * **wiki** a wiki I whipped up as a tech demo for a client.  It allowed custom themes to be uploaded and shared.
