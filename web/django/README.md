# Django Projects/Snippets

**Note** all these examples were written for Django 0.94 and Django 1.0rc.  There is little to no chance that they will run so I simply 
removed a lot of the boiler plate code and kept the important bits where possible.

 * **cms_models** various cms models, including versioning
 * **custom_template_tags** misc template tags, including switch statement
 * **sticky** restful stickynote website
 * **wiki** wiki with user uploadable templates
