# Javascript/jQuery UI Demos

After leaving WPI I tried to be a freelance web developer.  The projects I worked on in my spare time were often attempting to create specific UI features using jquery and javascript.  Here are a few demos:

 * **Autoscroll**: Replicated scrolling behavior of terminals (ie autoscroll when at the bottom)
 * **Better Back to Top**: allows the user to jump back to where they were before going to the top
 * **Dancing Bits**: An interactive media piece.  Updating "bit" (square) locations based on a list of coordinates, splitting and merging as need be.
 * **Default Checkboxes**: A way to handle "nothing selected" sensibly by assuming defaults (ie, no search criteria selected makes no sense, so use these search filters by default).
 * **Fixed Scroll**: Less laggy autoscrolling element than a manual update "onscroll"
 * **Help Overlays**: creates an overlay on any tag with a "help" attribute"
 * **Keymaps**: Prototype replication of Ableton Lives keymap feature
