# Javascript/jQuery UI Demos

After leaving WPI I tried to be a freelance web developer.  The projects I worked on in my spare time were often attempting to create specific UI features using jquery and javascript.  Here are a few demos:

 * **autoscroll**: scrolling behavior of terminals
 * **back to location**: jump back to previous position from top
 * **dancing bits**: an interactive media piece 
 * **default checkboxes**: defaults for when nothing is selected
 * **fixed scroll**: less laggy autoscrolling element 
 * **help overlays**: overlay for any tag with a "help" attribute"
 * **keymaps**: prototype replication of Ableton Lives keymap
