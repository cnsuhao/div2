# Javascript/jQuery UI Demos

After leaving WPI I tried to be a freelance web developer.  The projects I worked on in my spare time were often attempting to create specific UI features using jquery and javascript.  Here are a few demos:

 * **autoscroll.html** scrolling behavior of terminals
 * **backtoloc** jump back to previous position from top
 * **bits** an interactive media piece 
 * **checkbox** defaults for when nothing is selected
 * **fixed_scroll** less laggy autoscrolling element 
 * **help_overlays** overlay for any tag with a "help" attribute"
 * **keymap** prototype replication of Ableton Lives keymap
