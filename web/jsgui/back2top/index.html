<h1>Better Back To Top</h1>

<p>Sometimes a user might want to just hop back to the top of a document, but then be able to go right back.  This can be especially true for any metadata at the top, or a table of contents.  This page creates a link to send the user right back to there place.</p>

<p>Future features:  jump to any location in a document, not just back to the top. Similar to vim's ``. Link back could eventually fade out or disappear once the user starts to scroll.</p>
