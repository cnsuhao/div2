<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> I am sick and tired of javascript based fixed positioning.  It's laggy at best and broken at work.  Fortunately, there is CSS's fixed positioning, but that doesn't always work perfectly either if there are times when it shouldn't be fixed.  So, this attempt is a pretty straight forward way to fix it.  The box stays in a relative position until the page scrolls to far (past where it needs to be for a fixed position.  It then just animates to the new correct position and switches over to fixed positioning.  When it hits the next gate it stops.</p>

<p>A little info about the algorithm.  It's pretty basic as a rule.  The scroll position of a reference object (in this case the window) determines how far along a path you are.  The scrolling objects position is just a function of the scroll position of the reference object.  (No idea if that makes sense to anyone else.)</p>

This is a footer. It lives at the bottom of the page.<br/>
Though after this footer is more page room to prove the second end point stop.
