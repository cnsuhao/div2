# Artificial Intelligence

These are the major homeworks from when I took Intro to AI in 2007.  They were written in Dr. Scheme.  I have not attempted to run these files recently, but they all should have some sort of logfiles and writeup document.  

## Assignments:
 1. *basic-searches*:  Depth/Breadth/Best first searches
 2. *basic-rules*:  A simple rules engine
 3. *astar*:  Using A\* to solve a number-sliding puzzle and nqueens
 4. *gene-algo*:  Using genetic algorithms to figure out the best search and rescue team
