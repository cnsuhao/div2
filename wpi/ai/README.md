# Artificial Intelligence

These are the major homeworks from when I took Intro to AI in 2007.  They were
written in Dr. Scheme.  I have not attempted to run these files recently, but
they all should have some sort of log files and writeup document.  

 * **basic-searches**  depth/breadth/best first searches
 * **basic-rules**  simple rules engine
 * **astar**  using astar to solve a number-sliding puzzle and N-queens
 * **gene-algo**  genetic algorithm to figure out the best search and rescue team
