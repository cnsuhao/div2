Rules (pseudocode)
==================
	If increase-stress flag, then increase stress set amount and clear flag
	If stress is greater than 10, then end after declaring “mental breakdown”
    If stress is less than 0, then end after declaring “completely relaxed”
    If time since last relax is 0, then relax
    If time since last relax isn’t 0, subtract 1 from relax time
    If there is a hard task to be done, remove it and add stress
    If there is a fair task to be done, remove it and add stress
    If there is a easy task to be done, remove it and add stress
